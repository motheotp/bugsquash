## About

- This is a Bug Squash game.The laptop in the middle of the screen represents a program. Bugs enter the screen and crawl towards the laptop. If they get to the laptop, they infect your program with that particular bug. The game player clicks with the mouse on the moving bugs to squash them. However, some bugs, which we will refer to a Fat Bugs, are so severe that just squashing them will not work. For those you have to double-click, which brings up a simple program editor where you are required to fix the broken code:
